## ASP2VB


</div>

### Description

Convert ASP or HTML code into VB ready code for webclasses and web intended ActiveX dll's. It wraps HTML quotes, response.write's strings, converts <%= variable%>, and more. It can also be used to turn HTML into a format for dynamic page views with ASP. It's a very basic application, and I'm sure it can be improved, but it has already saved me *many* hours of tedious reformatting.
 
### More Info
 
Just paste code into the top textfield and click "convert"!

It returns the reformatted code in the lower textfield.

There may be some things you will still need to manually reformat. Also, it will write HTML to a single line. To fix this will require more than just adding vbCrLf to each line being parsed. Beware of trying to do it that way.
